## Abstract

We write slides for a million reasons, and each of those reasons comes with different priorities.
Regardless of which priorities you have, making your slides a better viewing experience should hopefully be one of them.
This talk will go over how we can take a default set of slides and turn them into something stunning.
we will be using Quarto as our medium but the advice is general.
Then we continue with a number of tips and tricks that are Quarto specific to take your slides to the next level.
